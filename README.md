# BioExcel UseCase 1: Antibody design  

The Use Case aims to address all the challenges related to antibody design through an
integrative approach combining the core BioExcel software comprising of
GROMACS (www.gromacs.org), HADDOCK and PMX. For more details see
https://bioexcel.eu/antibody-design-through-biomolecular-interactions-engineering/.

The folder molecular_dynamics contains the input files and script used for the MD
simulation.  Simulations have been performed with GROMACS version 2020 and
CHARMM36 force field 

The Use Case was presented at the BioExcel Summer School on Biomolecular
Simulation in 2021 (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7009238  or https://youtu.be/_TDKfKX4kwM)
